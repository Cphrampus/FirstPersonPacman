FInished maze, should be symmetric, but not perfect yet
Teleport works, the space is just there to have something to stop the player, may or may not be good to keep, we'll see


4/13: MAHIMNA
	Made Models for Ghost and added a few default movements to them. Addeed a few coins to the maze. Need to add more to fill the entire maze.

4/14: MAHIMNA
	Added a mantinee for a ghost to loop around the walls. I think instead of making implementing A* algorithm, it might be better to just work with mantinees.
	Have not tested in  VR though. Make sure it looks good.


4/20: CODY
	Added menu
	Added pause capability, mapped to backspace, doesn't hold, will just continue after a couple of seconds, wonder if this has to do with manintees not pausing well?
		might want to delete, unless we can figure out how to make it stay
	allowed mouse control and disabled auto-move for testing

4/21: CODY
	Added game over and reset to menu on death, pausing still isn't working well
	added score and life labels and life counter
	tried added fade to black on game end, did the same thing as menu, might have missed something..
	fixed jump powerup so you can collect it
	added congrats if you collect all coins, tested and this will end the game, can open new level
	Coins made a little bigger, can be hard to actually know if you get them or not
	should add music, pacman music is in a new folder, couldn't import them though...

4/22: MAHIMNA
	Got the pause button working.
	Added another level (Just the skeleton). Still have to update the locations of the coins and powerups
	Added some vector math to the non matinee ghosts so that they can start out from any direcrtion
 
4/23: MAHIMNA
	Converted the audio files to the proper format and imported them.
	Made Level 2 a lot cleaner and added transition between the levels
	Fixed the end game transition.
