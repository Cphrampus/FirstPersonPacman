4/7(CODY):
	Added chest and basic animation of opening, along with "popup" for the shift to move back
	Added triggers to hide and show obscuring features, may be useful, good for proof of concept at least
	Not really sure what to do with the second hall, just there now so I could do testing
	
	/* Mahimna:
		 Nice work with the animation of the chest. It looks very smooth.	
	*/

	
4/10(MAHIMNA):
	Added a little status bar to the top of the screen. It currently contains health and number of items. We could modify this later as required.
	Created a dummy throwable basketball object. To throw press Q. I was thinking we could use this to hit the enemies.
	Made the box collison pop up a text renderer so that the "hint" looks nicer.
